# 0lbap.github.io

My personal website, made with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework.

## Installing

Clone this repository and update its submodules recursively. This is needed because this website uses the [Papermod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) Hugo theme.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Usage

The following command will run a Hugo server for development:

```sh
hugo server
```
