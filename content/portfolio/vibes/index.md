title: “Vibes”, an emotional assistant app powered by AI
summary: The goal of this project is to complete the design, development, and testing of a mobile application in one semester, using generative AI as a tool. The application includes a daily journal where the user can check which emotions they feel, a chat-based AI assistant and an history graph of the emotions. After creating a prototype on Figma, we developed a REST API in Python, as well as an Android mobile interface using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Testing was done with Postman.
