title: “ErrBmb”, an online platform for rental accommodations
summary: The goal of this project is to explore the MEAN stack by developing an application that allows users to log in, create an account, and book rentals for specific periods. The application uses Mapbox for maps, JWT for authentication, and Zod for type validation. We developed and deployed both the client and API on the Render platform.
