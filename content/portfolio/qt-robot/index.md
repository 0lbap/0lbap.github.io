title: Integrating ChatGPT in the QT robot
summary: This research project aims to integrate a generative AI model in a social robot to implement the ability to listen, speak and show emotions. It was made in collaboration with the LIRMM laboratory during one semester, leading to a report and a defence, as well as a research paper published in SGAI 2024. A demonstration was carried out in a primary school classroom.
